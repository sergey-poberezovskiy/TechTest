The solution is built in ASP.Net Core MVC 3.1

Both front-end application and the web service are implemented in the same ASP.Net Core Web Application project.

ApiClient contains generic method to access API whilst the concrete call to the currency to words converter is in ApiClient.CheckWriter file.

The API location can be configured in appsettings.json, or if not - the local implementation is used.
